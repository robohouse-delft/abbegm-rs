## Re-generating protobuf messages.

The Rust code for the protobuf messages are generated using [`prost`](https://crates.io/crates/prost).
Normal users do not need to worry about this, but during development it may be necessary to re-generate the messages.
To do so, go into the `generate` folder and run the program:

```sh
cd "generate"
cargo run
```
